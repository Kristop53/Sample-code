Important notes:

This program requires a folder named "Recipies" on the desktop, with three subfolders inside named "Desserts", "Preservatives" and "Dinners" in order to work.
This is the default setting, which can be changed to a custom directory. Example files to test the code are in the Recipies folder in this repository.
