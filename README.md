Important notes:

This program comes with a sample folder with a few text files to showcase the correct way of operating. When starting Sample-Cookbook.py, Option 1 should have a default "Desserts" choice, and the second combobox should be empty. In order to select the file, first select the wanted category, and then files from the folder should appear if there exists at least one file, otherwise combobox 2 will remain empty as when starting the program

This is the default setting, which can be changed to a custom directory. Example files to test the code are in the Recipies folder in this repository.
