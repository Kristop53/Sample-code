This program comes with a sample folder with a few text files to showcase the correct way of operating. When starting Sample-Cookbook.py, Option 1 should have a default "Desserts" choice, and the second combobox should be empty. In order to select the file, first select the wanted category, and then files from the folder should appear if there exists at least one file, otherwise combobox 2 will remain empty as when starting the program

The folder must be called "Recipies", and can be placed anywhere in the os, as long as the user currently running the script has the folder. It doesn't matter where it's placed. It might take a minute for the code to succesfully compile and allow user to choose the file (a new window will appear when the folder was found).
